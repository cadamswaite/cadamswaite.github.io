<meta name="description" content="Konichiwa folks! I will be living in Japan from the end of February until May 2019 to do a research project at a University Hospital in Tokyo. I will be posting about life in Japan, places that I have travelled to, and possibly niche content on the pathology based research I am doing. Some posts will be massively retrospective as towards the end of my stay, the workload got pretty hectic and I didn’t have time to write as much as I would like, but I will try and do things in a chronological order. Tokyo, the capital city of Japan, is arguably the most populated metropolis in the world. What really hit me upon arrival was just how dense the buildings, both commercial and residential, were laid out in the city but unlike other major cities where you tend to find a concentrated centre which thins out in terms of building and population density. Tokyo seemingly maintains this intense density of housing and people for miles and miles out of the centre of the City. Our Accommodation was quite far outside of Tokyo. Far enough in fact that technically we were in Chiba Prefecture. Yet, as you took the Chuo Sobu Commuter train from the centre of town to our local station of Ichikawa, there was no feeling that you had left the City, Narrow streets draped with neon signs and telephone poles seem to repetitively swing past the train window as you left Tokyo City and crossed the Edogawa River to Ichikawa. For the duration of our stay, I would be living in University Accommodation near Ichikawa in a district called Konodai, along with the four other exchange students. All of us were doing research projects at a central Hospital as part of our undergraduate studies and we were living in a dormitory with other international exchange students from across all continents also conducting medical research in Japan. Settling in took longer than expected. We arrived at the end of February, London temperatures were still fairly mild when we left. The climate in Tokyo seems to be very cold winters, very hot summers and a mild in between period which luckily we would be able to experience. Our accommodation was not what we were used to, the spaces were small, the astronauts onboard the ISS probably have a bigger kitchen area and more hobs.. We had a single bed, and a large desk filling one side of the room and a air conditioning unit which doubled up as the heater for the room for the colder winter months. A small balcony outside provided a space to hang up washing, but also a habitat for some 6 -8 legged friends. The Exterior of our Accommodation, pastel colours on well fortified concrete bastions. First day in the new home, featuring Floppsy the toy rabbit. The international dormitory had an exterior appearance reminiscent of a minimum security detention centre, with barren concrete walls, rusting metal rails and some sort of watch tower painted a garish pastel pink to liften the spirits of the research inmates housed inside." />
