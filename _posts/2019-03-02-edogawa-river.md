A few days after moving to Japan and Ichikawa City, I felt the urge to explore the local neighbourhood. I had already seen enough of Konodai Campus, explored every aisle of the FamilyMart next to campus and in fact signed up for the FamilyMart Loyalty Card since the famichiki had a small discount if you were a member of the Loyalty Scheme. Having felt I’d seen enough of my immediate surroundings. on the first Saturday of my stay in Japan, I decided to go for a walk. Google Maps suggested the local park was fairly nice, with a few rave reviews of the rose garden. Not expecting much, I walked out of our accommodation compound and across the road into Satomi Park.

Satomi Park during weekdays is relatively quiet, with the occasional retiree taking their daily walk through the gently manicured hedges and trees. However, at the weekend, the atmosphere light up, with parents taking their children out to play on their days off, nature lovers armed with cannon length canon cameras pointing up into the tree branches waiting for birds.

People of all ages, all walks of life, liberated by the weekend came out in droves to the park and surrounding area on their days off. Some exercised, some played, some pursued their hobbies, others walked their dogs. It was incredibly warming to see this outburst of human energy.

I left Satomi Park and made my way towards the Edogawa River via steep stone steps leading down from the Park. It was here, framed by the trees of Satomi Park, was the Tokyo Metropolis sprawled in the hazy distance, the Tokyo Sky Tree dominating the skyline of the man made concrete forest.

On the left is the outline of the Tokyo Skytree, and towards the centre is the main business district of Shinjuku. Next to the river is the raised embankment which acts as a flood defence during natural disasters." %}

The Edogawa River forms the border between Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture. The river empties out into the Bay of Tokyo, near the Tokyo DisneySea Resort. What’s really interesting is the way that the river has been adapted to act as a Tsunami defence, with flood gates periodically installed along the banks of the river. A large water drainage system that operates in cavernous tunnels under Tokyo City eventually drain out into the Edogawa River. In the above photo you can see a raised grassy bank running alongside the river bank. This is a Tsunami defence wall but with a wide tarmac path running along the top, also doubles up as a leisure space for local residents.

A walk along the raised embankment reveals much about ordinary life in Japan and for me personally was a calming experience as I slowly acclimatised to my new temporary home. There was a sense of familiarity seeing the kids playing football and baseball by the river, a small group of men pulling little trailers stacked with radio controlled airplanes and helicopters had set up a little race track next to the river and were racing one another. This normality and community spirit was very relaxing to see, and opposite to the weekday work atmosphere of hurried men and women in business suits walking with stride and purpose to their engagements.

About 2 miles further north from Satomi Park along the Edogawa River, the buildings thinned out, and patches of farmland appear. It was a surprise to see agriculture so close to the city. A small shop by the side of the road sold produce and documented the use of this land over the last century as an important supply of food for the local population.

A slow saunter back to Konodai Campus late in the afternoon followed, the activities along the river continued, a small boat with a wake boarder went up and down the straight part of the river as the Sunlight eventually faded out.

I set out to walk through Satomi Park and along the river next to the dormitory just to explore the local area, but this turned out to be more than a google maps navigation exercise. I was somewhat apprehensive about the start of my stay in Japan. I was to live in a relatively poorly lit room which was quite cold at night, and had a musty smell like a damp attic. Apples were almost 4 times the cost in England, and the prospect of a Nandos Fino Wrap was distant at best. But this walk along the river normalised many elements of life in Japan. Seeing people outside of the weekday work environment, relaxing and being able to enjoy their time off with family and friends, partaking in hobbies and sports, made me feel more settled. Knowing that underneath the tough work ethic and ridiculously long working days, there was still life and joy to be had.
